    Changelog:
      - added option to set a default custom menu path and individual ones per value to better group the options in the menu. Supports placeholders for type (category, feature and tag) and action (add, remove and toggle).
      - added option to show/suppress the result dialog, that is shown after more than one game was processed.
      - added option to put all menu entries under one "Quick Add" entry.
      - changed icons to make the menus more readable. A check mark now indicates all games have that value, a check mark in a circle, that some have it and no icon indicates that no game has that value.
      - fixed bug that resulted in empty settings grids, when the addon settings were opened for the first time without opening a game context menu before.
      - complete translation to Ukrainian (thx SmithMD24!)
