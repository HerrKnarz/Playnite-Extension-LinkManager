# Link Utilities

This is an extension for the superb open source video game library manager and launcher [Playnite](http://playnite.link/). At the moment the extension does the following on button click:

- sort links by name
- library links - add links to the game page on steam, gog or itch, if the game is from those libraries.

It's very rudimentary yet, but I'm still learning how to code in C# after about seventeen years in Delphi ;)

## Planned features
- add more library links
- check if links are still working, optional removal of dead links
- automatically add links to several websites if a definite link can be found. The following sites are already planned:
  - Wikipedia
  - MobyGames
  - IGDB
  - Steam
  - GOG
  - PCGamingWiki
  - MetaCritic
  - HardcoreGaming 101
  - Sega Retro
  - Lemon Amiga
  - VGMdb
- search feature for several sites
- search for screenshots with configurable resolution

If you have more ideas for this extension, feel free to suggest them by opening an issue!
