# Link Utilities

This is an extension for the superb open source video game library manager and launcher [Playnite](http://playnite.link/). At the moment it can do the following:

- Sort links by name or custom sort order via game menu or optionally automatically after metadata change.
- Remove unwanted links (e.g. social media links added by IGDB) via game menu or optionally automatically after metadata change.
- Rename links (e.g. shorten wikipedia to wiki) via game menu or optionally automatically after metadata change.
- Add links to several websites directly by trying to find a valid link using the game name
- Search for games on several websites to add links via search dialog
- Add library links: add links to the game page of its library
- Add link to active website in your browser via bookmarklet (see [wiki](https://github.com/HerrKnarz/Playnite-Extension-LinkUtilities/wiki/URL-handler-and-bookmarklet#bookmarklet) for more information). Works with any website.

To see which websites are already supported or planned to be added see the [wiki](https://github.com/HerrKnarz/Playnite-Extension-LinkUtilities/wiki/Supported-websites-for-add-search-function)!

## Planned features
- add links to more websites.
- check if links are still working, optional removal of dead links (postponed for now, because several sites return 403 when checked without real browser)

If you have more ideas for this extension, feel free to suggest them by opening an issue!
