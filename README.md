# Link Utilities

This is an extension for the superb open source video game library manager and launcher [Playnite](http://playnite.link/). At the moment it can do the following:

- Sort links by name via game menu or optionally automatically after meta data change.
- Add links to the following websites directly via game name or search dialog:
  - MobyGames
  - PCGamingWiki
  - Wikipedia
- Add library links - add links to the game page on steam, gog or itch, if the game is from those libraries.

## Planned features
- add Epic as library link
- check if links are still working, optional removal of dead links
- add link to active browser window via bookmarklet (nearly done, but currently broken in playnite API)
- add links to more websites. The following are already planned:
  - Steam
  - GOG
  - Epic
  - MetaCritic
  - HardcoreGaming 101
  - Sega Retro
  - Lemon Amiga
  - VGMdb
  - IGDB (was included till 0.4 but had to be removed because it wasn't working as intended)
- (maybe) search for screenshots with configurable resolution

If you have more ideas for this extension, feel free to suggest them by opening an issue!
