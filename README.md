# Link Utilities

This is an extension for the superb open source video game library manager and launcher [Playnite](http://playnite.link/). At the moment the extension does the following:

- sort links by name via game menu or optionally automatically after meta data change
- add links to MobyGames, PCGamingWiki and Wikipedia directly via game name or search dialog
- library links - add links to the game page on steam, gog or itch, if the game is from those libraries.

## Planned features
- add Epic as library link
- add the active website in a web browser as a link to the selected games via URL command and bookmarklet in Chrome etc.
- check if links are still working, optional removal of dead links
- add link to active browser window via bookmarklet (nearly done, but currently broken in playnite API)
- add links to more several websites. The following sites are already planned:
  - IGDB
  - Steam
  - GOG
  - Epic
  - MetaCritic
  - HardcoreGaming 101
  - Sega Retro
  - Lemon Amiga
  - VGMdb
- search feature for several sites
- search for screenshots with configurable resolution
